		<h3>Overall Ski</h3>
		<p>The meaning of the term Overall is a scoring system.  The way this scoring works is it adds slalom, trick, and jump scores together.  The combined score will show who wins in the Three Event.  Overall scores are figured out at every official tournament that qualifies a contender for all three events.</p>
