		<h3>Slalom</h3>
		<p>Slalom skiing is on only one ski with two footplates.  Once the skier can ski crossing the boat's wake, the skier can then start going around six buoys in a ski course. The boat’s top speed is 36mph.</p>

		<h3>Trick</h3>
		<p>Trick skiing is on one or two much smaller ski/s and the footplates are set differently than a slalom ski.  The skier has a time limit to perform tricks that are worth points.  The boat speed varies on the rider’s preference; usually anywhere from 12mph to 24mph.</p>

		<h3>Jump</h3>
		<p>Jump skiing is when the skier skis on two skis. They are larger, longer, and wider than a slalom ski.  The skier swings from one side to the other, crossing the boat’s wake. A pro-skier can travel to a speed up to 90mph just before hitting a five or six feet fiberglass ramp. It is hard to believe that the boat’s top speed is 45mph. The world record holder in jump skiing flew over 300 feet in the air.</p>

		<h3>Overall</h3>
		<p>The meaning of the term Overall is a scoring system.  The way overall scoring works is to adds the slalom, trick, and jump scores together.  The combined total score will determine the winner of the Overall 3-Event.  Overall scores are figured out at every official tournament that qualifies a contender for all three events.</p>
