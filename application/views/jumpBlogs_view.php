		<h3>Jump Ski</h3>
		<p>Jump skiing is where the skier skis on two skis. They are larger, longer, and wider than a slalom ski.  The skier swings from one side to the other, crossing the boat’s wake. A pro skier can travel to a speed up to 90MPHs just before hitting a 5-6 feet fiberglass ramp. It can be hard to believe that the boat’s top speed is 45MPHs. The world record holder in jump skiing flew over 300 feet in the air.</p>
